Through its main electricity utility company, Kenya Power, Kenya has signed at least 42 PPAs with private developers to address high electricity tariffs. Yet, electricity prices in Kenya continued to rise. On 29th March 2021, President Kenyatta appointed a Taskforce for the Review of Power Purchase Agreements (the Taskforce). The Taskforce was tasked to review existing PPAs,  investigate why electricity prices were rising despite these agreements, and possibly terminate or renegotiate unfavorable ones.  All ongoing PPA negotiations were also halted during the Taskforce’s tenure. A year later, in 2023, a proposal for legislative reforms followed, with Senator Edwin Sifuna sponsoring the Energy (Amendment) Bill, 2023 a senator proposing new measures meant to enhance the management of PPAs. These efforts reveal that PPAs are far more complex than they appear and do not automatically result in electricity price reductions.\\nThis article explores the nature of PPAs, their implementation challenges in Kenya, and their impact on electricity prices.

The need for renewable energy integration could also necessitate a PPA. For context, geothermal and hydro, which are renewable sources, account for over 65% of Kenya’s generation mix.  As suchGiven Kenya’s predominantly renewable generation mix (primarily geothermal and hydroelectric), the motivation for PPAs should center more on capacity expansion and other needs than renewable energy transition.\\nOnce needs assessment studies have been conducted, the conventional procurement process involves competitive auctions where IPPs bid in response to utility requests for proposals. Price competitiveness is a primary selection criterion in the process. However, IPPS may sometimes approach the government with unsolicited proposals, resulting in a PPA. Such non-competitive arrangements often result in suboptimal pricing structures, ultimately transferring higher costs to end consumers. This practice contradicts the fundamental objective of PPA frameworks: achieving cost-efficient electricity generation through market competition.\\nOnce an IPP has been selected, they enter into the negotiation phase to nail down the specifics of the agreement before signing.

This has led to high tariffs which the utility passes on to the final consumer.\\nThe underutilization of thermal power plants, as indicated by the low utilization factor (Table 1), has driven up costs per kWh, undermining the initial goal of price reduction. Utilization factor at dispatch is the ratio of actual energy output from a generation source to its maximum capacity on a near-real-time basis. The low utilization factors from IPPs in Table 1 raise critical questions about optimal capacity planning and the appropriate balance between baseload and peak power sources. If high-cost power plants are underutilized, does this imply an inefficient use of resources, or is it desirable because their operation is reserved for peak times? Additionally, why aren't cheaper energy sources prioritized more effectively, and are capacity payments for unused plants adding unnecessary financial burdens? Furthermore, if only 11-14% of installed capacities are being utilized, would it have been more prudent to negotiate smaller Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to align better with demand patterns?
